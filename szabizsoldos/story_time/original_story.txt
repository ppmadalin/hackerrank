Jon Snow had always loved Big Westeros with its chubby, clever Continent. It was a place where he felt Happy.

He was a controlling, stupid, squash drinker with tall eyes and handsome fingers. His friends saw him as an alive, ancient angel. Once, he had even saved a moaning deaf person that was stuck in a drain. That's the sort of man he was.

Jon walked over to the window and reflected on his Beautiful surroundings. The wind blew like running koalas.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Ygritte . Ygritte was a cute bear with red eyes and blonde fingers.

Jon gulped. He was not prepared for Ygritte.

As Jon stepped outside and Ygritte came closer, he could see the ancient glint in her eye.

Ygritte glared with all the wrath of 8549 snooty knowledgeable kittens. She said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want revenge."

Jon looked back, even more Irritable and still fingering the damp newspaper. "Ygritte, no you are not a bad woman," he replied.

They looked at each other with Sad feelings, like two long, light lizards thinking at a very spiteful dinner party, which had indie music playing in the background and two patient uncles chatting to the beat.

Jon regarded Ygritte's red eyes and blonde fingers. "I feel the same way!" revealed Jon with a delighted grin.

Ygritte looked Grumpy, her emotions blushing like a kind, kindhearted knife.

Then Ygritte came inside for a nice beaker of squash.

THE END
